    <title>Cordon Sanitaire Introduction</title>

<body>

<p>Cordon Sanitaire will last 45 seconds, but no one knows exactly when. We'll give you a warning by text... come back and join in with everyone else who's playing.</p>
<p>The game models quarantine efforts -- trying to isolate a contagious "Patient Zero" in an urban environment. This requires commitment and co-ordination ... without communication.</p>
<p>In the game, you have one job: help isolate Patient Zero from everyone else.</p>
<p>You can join the quarantine perimeter, to keep Patient Zero isolated. Or you can drop from the perimeter, which will adapt around you. But don't trap healthy citizens in there with Patient Zero.</p>
<p>In the end, the smallest, tightest, quarantine will be successful. And that success is up to you ... all of you.</p>
