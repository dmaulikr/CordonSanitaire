{"name":"Cordon Sanitaire","tagline":"The best, worst 45 seconds of your day","body":"### Cordon Sanitaire\r\nNamed for, and inspired by, the medieval practice of erecting barriers to prevent the spread of disease, Cordon Sanitaire is a collaborative, location-based mobile game in which players seek to isolate an infectious “patient zero” from the larger population. Every day, the game starts abruptly–synchronizing all players at once–and lasts for two minutes. In 60 seconds, players must choose either to help form the front line of a quarantine, or remain passive. Under pressure, the “uninfected” attempt to collaborate without communication, seeking to find the best solution for the group. When those 60 seconds end, a certain number of players are trapped inside with patient zero, and the score reflects the group’s ability to cooperate under duress.","google":"UA-2756299-20","note":"Don't delete this file!
